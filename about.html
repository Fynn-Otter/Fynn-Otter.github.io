        <div class="aboutMe">
            Thank you for visiting my site, my name is Matthew Butter. I am studying (BEng) Cyber Security and Forensics at Edinburgh Napier University.
            I have created this site for my 2nd year 'Web Technologies' class with Simon Wells as my lecturer.
            <p>
            I first orginally studied a (BSc) Computer Games Design at Glasgow, where afterwards I moved to Newcastle to work for an insurance company repairing video game consoles before my studies at Napier
            I repaired Xbox one, Xbox Series, PS4, PS5 and Nintendo Switches. Shortly after I ran my own smartwatch repair department for the company and oversaw the further devlopment of
            the Nintedo Switch Depertment and even assisted in creating the VR headset repair department also.
            <p>
            While I havent played <i>Magic the Gathering</i> in a good few years, its always has been in a place of my heart since I was growing up, with a group of my friends
            coming together once every week play play some games, build decks and just have fun for a good few hours till late into the night.
            <p>
            In my free time, I mainly play Video Games with my friends, or play the Arkham Horror. The Card Game, with my friends or occasionally travel or attend convention to participate
            in cosplay
